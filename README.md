Final Project

  WEB Application for comparing prices between different types of transportation.
  
  The application has registration, login and it uses email confirmation.
  
  Every registered user can add route with starting and ending point.
  
  Then you can request for travel price comparison for some route. You enter the route, your car fuel expense and the type of fuel it uses. The application then will send   you response with the prices for all types of transportation (plance, train, bus, car).  

Then you can compare the prices and the time it requires and you can take your decision.
