Final Project

  WEB Application for comparing prices between different types of transportation.
  
  The application has registration and login.
  
  Every registered user can add route with starting and ending point.
  
  Then you can request for travel price comparison for some route. The application then will send you response with the prices for all types of transportation (plane, train, bus, car).  

Then you can compare the prices and the time it requires and you can take your decision.
